                            I earned my PhD in Astrophysics at the University of Minnesota by developing custom Python scripts and modules to analyze mass-loss from hypergiant stars.  Now I use my analytical skills to create enterprise-grade applications with a focus on just-in-time development.

                            I recently graduated from University of Minnesota with a Master's Degree in Computer Science.
                            I was in the spatial Database research group, and did my graduation project on spatial data clustering and prediction in agricultural crop yield. I worked as TA before. <br/>
                            My previous work experience mostly lies in Web Developing (full stack) and Android Developing (in both academy and industry). I love programming and seeing people use tools I built.
